# Topology and structure files for simulation systems.

This repository stores the following data: 
- NaCl system
- FKBP with DMSO, DSS, and BUT systems
- Streptavidin-biotin system

For each, the folloing files are provided:
- The topology file for each system (.top). 
- The energy-minimised structure of each system (em.gro).
- Ligand topology files (.itp)
